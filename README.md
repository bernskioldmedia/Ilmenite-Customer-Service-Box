# Ilmenite Plugin Base
This is a simple plugin base for a WordPress plugin that we use at
Bernskiold Media when creating custom plugin's for our clients.

This base is kept extremely simple in order to just facilitate a quick start.
The only code bits that we have included are for taxonomies and post types,
which are almost always used in every new plugin.

We will add more (or less) to this plugin base as our development needs change.

## Coding Style
We exclusively try and use the WordPress coding practices for all languages,
which includes PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This base plugin is in part OOP based to both live in its own namespace,
and to make extending, updating and maintaining code simple and easy.

## Open Source
The reason we are open sourcing it is because it's the right thing to do.
Perhaps someone finds a use out of it all, or parts. This is not going to be
an actively developed "master plugin base" that is set out to be the next
greatest thing in the WordPress community. It's just going to be what
we use internally, just published for the world to see and use as you see fit.
